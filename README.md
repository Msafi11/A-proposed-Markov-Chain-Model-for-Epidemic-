# A-proposed-Markov-Chain-Model-for-Epidemic-
The goal of this project is to predict the next possible state of epidemic propagation and analyze all the possible 
states of the epidemic Markov chain (Absorbing state, Recurrent state, Transient state, 
Periodic state,...).

A model that allows the study of an infection spreading in a 
society. solved this model and calibrated it to India, and this model was fully 
assisted in capturing the Covid-19 pandemic dispersion's general behavior.
